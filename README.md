An API used for throttling effect(debouncing). 

Debouncing is a programming technique used by developers to limit the number of calls to an event or only trigger a function when needed or for only one use case. The debouncing technique is applied in a time-consuming function that has a lot of computations so we avoid the unnecessary calling of that function. To be specific, debouncing can be applied in search bars, suggestive text bars, content loading web pages e.g Facebook, Instagram, and so on.

Debouncing Implementation
We can implement debounce in JavaScript using the steps given below:
   - Create a delay timer inside the function and set it to 0
   - Reset the timer if the specified function is invoked again
   - Call the debounce function only when timeout.
